Reflection
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was tasked with developing a program that could load, store, and display computer science course information efficiently. The key challenge was selecting and implementing appropriate data structures to ensure both performance and maintainability.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by analyzing the requirements: fast search, sorted output, and scalability. Understanding data structures was crucial because the choice between a vector, hash table, or binary search tree significantly impacts the programâ€™s performance and complexity.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame issues like file parsing errors and incorrect tree insertion logic by reviewing debugging outputs, re-reading project instructions carefully, and testing each part of the code incrementally.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on these projects taught me to design programs more systematically, focusing on data organization early in the process and making sure the code structure supports future feature expansion and maintenance.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This experience made me prioritize writing clean, well-documented code with clear function separations. I learned to think more about scalability and future readability, not just getting the code to work for now.
